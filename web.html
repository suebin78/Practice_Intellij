      <h2>WEB</h2>
        <p>
          Web, traditionally styled WEB, is a computer programming system created by Donald E. Knuth as the first implementation of what he called
          "literate programming": his idea that one could create software as works of literature, by embedding source code in descriptive text,
          rather than the reverse. Unlike standard programming practice which relegates documentation to comments, the WEB approach is to write
          an article to document the making of the source code, and to include all the source code in that article, so as to be compilable therefrom.
